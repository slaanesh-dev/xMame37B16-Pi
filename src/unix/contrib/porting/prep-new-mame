#!/bin/bash
# This is a script which automates some of the operations needed for porting DOS
# MAME to Un*x.  Run it in a directory containing the latest MAME sources,
# unzipped with the -L option to make all the filenames lower case.  Also, you
# must specify a previous xmame release's source directory.  For example, here's
# what I would do in my ~/emulators directory to port 0.37b14:
#           mkdir xmame-0.37b14.1
#           cd xmame-0.37b14.1
#           unzip -L ../M37B14.ZIP
#           prep-new-mame ../xmame-0.37b13.2
