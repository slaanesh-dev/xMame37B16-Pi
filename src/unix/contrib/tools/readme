5)	Name:		romulan.pl
	Author:		Nathan Hand <nathanh@chirp.com.au>
	Description:	Perl script I've been working on to keep track of
                        split romsets. Relies on xmame + unzip binaries being
                        available, doesn't support merged sets, doesn't
                        support unzipped sets, doesn't examine ~/.xmamerc,
                        doesn't do a lot really. I use it personally though,
                        and I find it useful.
                        
                        Has some neat routines (in perl) to get romset info
                        out of xmame or the zipfile. Might be useful to other
                        romset analyzer developers.
