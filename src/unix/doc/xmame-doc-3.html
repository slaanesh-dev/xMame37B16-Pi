<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 What is mame?</A>
</H2>

<P>Mame is an arcade machine emulator. Started in 1997 by Nicola
Salmoria, mame started out as a series of emulators for  individual
games. This series of emulators was combined into a  simgle multi-game
emulator. This is the current form of mame; no longer a one-man show,
there are over 100 contributors to the project.
<P>Mame was created by Nicola Salmoria.
<P>Also see 
<A HREF="readme.mame">the official mame readme file (readme.mame)</A><P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 What is mess?</A>
</H2>

<P>Mess is just like mame---a virtual machine emulator, only it
doesn't emulate arcade machines but rather computers and consoles.
<P>Also see 
<A HREF="readme.mess">the official mess readme file (readme.mess)</A><P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 What is xmame/xmess?</A>
</H2>

<P>Xmame/xmess are the Unix/X11 ports of the mame and mess projects.
It makes mame/mess available on *ix machines using the X11R6 X-Window
System (and SVGAlib/ggi/XF86-DGA/OpenGL/SDL too).
<P>Mame was orginally ported by Allard Van Der Bas, Dick the Ridder,
Juan Antonio Martinez, and Hans de Goede.
<P>Xmame/xmess is currently maintained by Lawrence Gold.
<H2><A NAME="ss3.4">3.4 What are the differences between mame/mess and xmame/xmess?</A>
</H2>

<P>None significant.
<P>Xmame/xmess is based on the mame/mess source code. Due to technical
reasons beyond the scope of this document, the mame/mess source may
not compile under Unix. That's why the xmame/xmess project exists.
Each time mame/mess is updated, the code is tested  (and patched
if needed) under Unix. This way xmame/xmess releases are always the
same as their mame counterparts.
<P>There are no plans for the independent development of xmame/xmess.
<H2><A NAME="ss3.5">3.5 What hardware and operating systems are supported? </A>
</H2>

<P>Xmame runs on both little-endian and big-endian CPUs, using aligned
integer access if needed and is compatible with 64 bit CPUs. The
current list of supported CPUs in the makefile is:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>i386 + gnu-asm</LI>
<LI>i386 no asm</LI>
<LI>alpha</LI>
<LI>ia64 (merced)</LI>
<LI>m68k</LI>
<LI>generic risc (PowerPC, Sparc, HPPA, IBM)</LI>
<LI>generic risc, lsb-first (RISC (Ultrix machines))</LI>
<LI>mips (generic risc + SGI compiler bug workarounds)</LI>
</UL>
<P>Adding support for another cpu (if necessary) should be trivial.
<P>The following Unix platforms are specifically supported:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Linux</LI>
<LI>FreeBSD</LI>
<LI>NetBSD</LI>
<LI>Solaris (SunOS)</LI>
<LI>OpenStep (noasm only on i386)</LI>
<LI>IRIX with sound using the dmedia package or the new al package
(sound currently broken)</LI>
<LI>AIX (sound currently broken)</LI>
<LI>generic unix, no sound</LI>
</UL>
<P>The generic unix entry should work for any reasonable standard
Unix variant, but lacks sound since there is no single Unix sound
standard.
<P>On all platforms, zlib is now needed since the core uses it.
Ff you don't have zlib, use the included one by uncommenting the
appropriate line in Makefile.
<P>The following display methods are supported. X11 is the only
one which works on all platforms, except for OpenStep which only
works with Openstep bitmaps:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>X11 (X-Window System)</LI>
<LI>svgalib</LI>
<LI>GGI (Generic Graphics Interface)</LI>
<LI>OpenGL using X11 for input</LI>
<LI>glide using X11 for input (3DFX)</LI>
<LI>glide using svgalib for input (3DFX)</LI>
<LI>OpenStep bitmaps</LI>
<LI>SDL (Simple Direct Medialayer)</LI>
</UL>
<P>The following is a list of arch/os/display combinations, with
maintainers, for arch/os/display combinations which are actively
supported. Please mail the maintainer of the arch/os/display combination
for compilation and other arch/os/display specific problems. Mail
Lawrence <CODE>
<A HREF="mailto:gold@aros.net">gold@aros.net</A></CODE> for generic (e.g., X11) problems.

<P>* These are supported using the generic unix entry of the makefile,
and thus lack sound.
<P>We are always looking for people willing to test and answer questions
about xmame on a new arch/os/display. This takes very little work
and could help other people tremendously. If you're interested, mail
Lawrence <CODE>
<A HREF="mailto:gold@aros.net">gold@aros.net</A></CODE>.
<H2><A NAME="ss3.6">3.6 My system is supported but xmame/xmess gives me errors and fails.</A>
 Why?</H2>

<P>Xmame/xmess should run on 8bpp Pseudo Color displays and on 16,
24 and 32bpp True Color displays. If your X-Server does not support
any  of these display types, xmame/xmess will not run.
<P>You can verify your X-Server support by starting your X-Server
and running the xdpyinfo program. See the xdpyinfo manual page 
for more information.
<H2><A NAME="ss3.7">3.7 What is the role of the xmamerc/xmessrc file?</A>
</H2>

<P>A normal xmame/xmess invocation looks like:
<P>
<PRE>
    xmame pacman -sound -nojoy -frameskip 2 -heightscale 3 \   
        -widthscale 2
</PRE>
<P>Most of the time, you will want to use the same configuration
for  each game. xmame/xmess will read this file for default values
for the  parameters that you can set. This way the only parameters
you  need to express on the command line are the ones you want to
override.
<P>Another reason for xmamerc/xmessrc is keyboard remapping. Some
Unix  keyboards are very different than their PC counterparts. To
compensate for the changes, xmame/xmess allows you to remap keys
that  are not available on Unix keyboards to keys that are available.
<H2><A NAME="ss3.8">3.8 What is the syntax of the xmamerc/xmessrc file.</A>
</H2>

<P>The syntax is quite simple:
<P>
<PRE>
   &quot;keyword value&quot;
</PRE>
<P>See 
<A HREF="xmamerc.dist">xmamerc.dist</A>
for most keywords. Allmost all commandline options can
be used as keywords (without the -), use value 0 or 1 for commandline
options which have a negating (-no[option]) counterpart.
As usual lines begining with &quot;#&quot; are comments.
<P>You can also generate a configfile with all the current settings
to use as a template by typing:
<P>
<PRE>
   xmame -showconfig &gt; ~/.xmame/xmamerc
</PRE>
<H2><A NAME="FAQ: Where do roms, images, samples, highscores, configfiles, etc go?"></A> <A NAME="ss3.9">3.9 Where do roms, images, samples, highscores, configfiles, etc</A>
 go? </H2>

<H3>Roms/Samples</H3>

<P>Xmame/xmess uses a &quot;:&quot; seperated rompath to find out
which dirs to search for roms/samples.
<P>The default rompath is XMAMEROOT as defined in Makefile during
compile.
<P>This is overwritten by any rompath in xmamerc/xmessrc, which
can be overwritten again with the -rompath commandline option.
<P>Xmame/xmess searches every dir in this path for roms/samples
in the following way:
<P>
<PRE>
    &lt;dir&gt;/gamename.zip             (containing filename.ext)
    &lt;dir&gt;/gamename/filename.ext
    &lt;dir&gt;/gamename/filename.ext.gz (containing filename.ext)
    &lt;dir&gt;/gamename/filename.zip    (containing filename.ext)
</PRE>
<P>So let's say that we are searching for rom0001.1, which is part
of pacman. Then xmame/xmess would search every dir in your rompath
for
<P>
<PRE>
    &lt;dir&gt;/pacman.zip               (containing rom0001.1)
    &lt;dir&gt;/pacman/rom0001.1
    &lt;dir&gt;/pacman/rom0001.1.gz      (containing rom0001.1)
    &lt;dir&gt;/pacman/rom0001.zip       (containing rom0001.1)
</PRE>
<P>Note: If your neogeo games can't find neogeo.rom, put it in a
dir called neogeo somewhere in your rompath, or put it in neogeo.zip
somewhere in your rompath.
<H3>Read/write Diskette Images</H3>

<P>This section only applies to xmess emulations which support read/write
diskette images and thus try to open the image read/write.
<P>Xmess first searches for read/write images with the name specified
on the commandline:
<P>
<PRE>
    &lt;path&gt;/image.ext
</PRE>
<P>where path is the path specified with the image on the commandline.
This way, absolute and relative filenames can be used directly on
the commandline for an image which is not in the rompath.
<P>Then xmess searches every dir in the rompath for roms/samples
in the following way:
<P>
<PRE>
    &lt;dir&gt;/image.ext
</PRE>
<P>Note that (g)zipped images are not supported for r/w images.
<H3>Rom Cartridges/Read Only Diskette Images</H3>

<P>Xmess begins by searching for cartdriges/disks from the current
dir in the following way:
<P>
<PRE>
    &lt;path&gt;/image.ext
    &lt;path&gt;/image.ext.gz            (containing image.ext)
    &lt;path&gt;/image.zip               (containing image.ext)
</PRE>
<P>where path is the path specified with the image on the commandline.
This way, absolute and relative filenames can be used directly on
the commandline for an image which is not in the rompath.
<P>Then xmess searches every dir in the rompath for carts/images
in the following way:
<P>
<PRE>
    &lt;dir&gt;/image.ext
    &lt;dir&gt;/image.ext.gz             (containing image.ext)
    &lt;dir&gt;/image.zip                (containing image.ext)
</PRE>
<P>Finally, xmess searches the rompath as desribed above using the
systemtype for gamename.
<P>So let's say we want to play mario.nes on the nes emulation of
xmess. We would then type: &quot;xmess nes mario.nes&quot;. Xmess
then begins by searching the current dir for
<P>
<PRE>
    mario.nes
    mario.nes.gz                   (containing mario.nes)
    mario.zip                      (containing mario.nes)
</PRE>
<P>After that, xmess searches each dir in your rompath for
<P>
<PRE>
    &lt;dir&gt;/mario.nes
    &lt;dir&gt;/mario.nes.gz             (containing mario.nes)
    &lt;dir&gt;/mario.zip                (containing mario.nes)
</PRE>
<P>And finally, xmess searches each dir in your rompath for
<P>
<PRE>
    &lt;dir&gt;/nes.zip                  (containing mario.nes)
    &lt;dir&gt;/nes/mario.nes
    &lt;dir&gt;/nes/mario.nes.gz         (containing mario.nes)
    &lt;dir&gt;/nes/mario.zip            (containing mario.nes)
</PRE>
<P>Since xmess first searches for cartridges/disks from the current
dir you can also specify cartridges/disks not in your rompath. For
example:
<P>
<PRE>
    &quot;xmess nes ../mario.nes&quot;
</PRE>
<P>Xmess then searches for
<P>
<PRE>
    ../mario.nes
    ../mario.nes.gz                (containing mario.nes)
    ../mario.zip                   (containing mario.nes)
</PRE>
<P>and will also search the rompath as described above with ../mario.nes
as the image name but this is not that useful.
<H3>Artwork</H3>

<P>Xmame/xmess searches every dir in the rompath for artwork in
the following way:
<P>
<PRE>
    &lt;dir&gt;/artwork.png
    &lt;dir&gt;/artwork.png.gz           (containing artwork.png)
    &lt;dir&gt;/artwork.zip              (containing artwork.png)
</PRE>
<P>Then xmame/xmess searches the rompath as in roms/samples.
<P>So let's say we want to play foo which uses bar.png. Xmame/xmess
then begins searching each dir in your rompath for
<P>
<PRE>
    &lt;dir&gt;/bar.png
    &lt;dir&gt;/bar.png.gz               (containing bar.png)
    &lt;dir&gt;/bar.zip                  (containing bar.png)
</PRE>
<P>And then xmame/xmess searches each dir in your rompath for
<P>
<PRE>
    &lt;dir&gt;/foo.zip                  (containing bar.png)
    &lt;dir&gt;/foo/bar.png
    &lt;dir&gt;/foo/bar.png.gz           (containing bar.png)
    &lt;dir&gt;/foo/bar.zip              (containing bar.png)
</PRE>
<H3>Xmame configuration</H3>

<P>Xmame looks for the following configuration files and parses
each one found. Files parsed later can overwrite options in previously
parsed files:
<P>
<PRE>
    XMAMEROOT/xmamerc
    XMAMEROOT/xmame-DISPLAY_METHODrc
    ${HOME}/.xmame/xmamerc
    ${HOME}/.xmame/xmame-DISPLAY_METHODrc
    ${HOME}/.xmame/rc/&lt;gamename&gt;rc
</PRE>
<P><CODE>XMAMEROOT</CODE> is defined during compile time, see Makefile.
<P><CODE>DISPLAY_METHOD</CODE> is the <CODE>DISPLAY_METHOD</CODE> for which xmame was compiled,
this can be one of: x11, svgalib, ggi, xgl, xfx, svgafx, openstep,
SDL.
<P>For xmess of course replace xmame by xmess. ;)
<H3>Game configuration</H3>

<P>Game configuration files are kept on a per-user base in:
<P>
<PRE>
    ${HOME}/.xmame/cfg/&lt;game&gt;.cfg resp
    ${HOME}/.xmess/cfg/&lt;game&gt;.cfg
</PRE>
<H3>Game state</H3>

<P>Game state files are kept on a per-user base in:
<P>
<PRE>
    ${HOME}/.xmame/sta/&lt;game&gt;.sta resp
    ${HOME}/.xmess/sta/&lt;game&gt;.sta
</PRE>
<H3>NVram</H3>

<P>NVram files are kept on a per-user base in:
<P>
<PRE>
    ${HOME}/.xmame/nvram/&lt;game&gt;.nv resp
    ${HOME}/.xmess/nvram/&lt;game&gt;.nv
</PRE>
<H3>Mem cards</H3>

<P>Mem cards files are kept on a per-user base in:
<P>
<PRE>
    ${HOME}/.xmame/mem/&lt;filename&gt;.mem resp
    ${HOME}/.xmess/mem/&lt;filename&gt;.mem
</PRE>
<P>Where &lt;filename&gt; is given by the game-driver. 
<H3>Screenshots</H3>

<P>Screenshots, which can be made by pressing F12, are saved as
png files in the directory from where xmame is started (cwd).
<P>This can be overidden by the screenshotdir entry in xmamerc/xmessrc,
which can again be overidden by the <CODE>-screenshotdir</CODE> cmdline-option.
<P>They are saved as:
<P>
<PRE>
    &lt;screenshotdir&gt;/&lt;game&gt;xxxx.png
    Where xxxx is a number.
</PRE>
<H3>Highscores</H3>

<P>Highscores are stored in XMAMEROOT as defined in Makefile when
building. This can be overidden by the spooldir entry in xmamerc/xmessrc,
which can again be overidden by the <CODE>-spooldir</CODE> cmdline-option.
<P>So only give a 
<P>
<PRE>
    drwxrwsr-x root games &lt;spooldir&gt;
</PRE>
<P>permission and setgid xmame/xmess to &quot;games&quot; to get
it to work. Note this doesn't work with suid root versions (svgalib
&amp; XF86-DGA), suggestions welcome.
<P>For now use <CODE>${HOME}/.xmame</CODE> or <CODE>$ {HOME}/.xmess</CODE>
as the spooldir in xmamerc/xmessrc for  suid root versions.
<P>Note: For highscores to work, xmame must also be able to find
hiscore.dat.
<H3>hiscore.dat</H3>

<P>If you want to use highscores mame needs to load hiscore.dat
to get highscore info.
<P>The default is <CODE>XMAMEROOT</CODE>/hiscore.dat . XMAMEROOT is set during
compile-time; see the Makefile. This can be overridden by the hiscorefile
entry in xmamerc if present, which can again be overridden by the
cmdline-option <CODE>-hiscorefile</CODE>.
<P><CODE>hiscore.dat</CODE> is available from the mame homepage: 
<A HREF="http://www.mame.net">http://www.mame.net</A><P>
<H3>cheat.dat</H3>

<P>If you want to use cheats mame needs to load cheat.dat to get
cheat info.
<P>The default is XMAMEROOT/cheat.dat . XMAMEROOT is set during
compile-time; see the Makefile. This can be overridden by the cheatfile
entry in xmamerc if present, which can again be overridden by the
cmdline-option <CODE>-cheatfile</CODE>.
<P><CODE>cheat.dat</CODE> is available from the mame homepage: 
<A HREF="http://www.mame.net">http://www.mame.net</A><P>
<H3>history.dat</H3>

<P>If you want to display some nice background info on games, mame
needs to load history.dat.
<P>The default is XMAMEROOT/history.dat . XMAMEROOT is set during
compile-time, see the Makefile. This can be overridden by the historyfile
entry in xmamerc if present, which can again be overridden by the
cmdline-option <CODE>-historyfile</CODE>.
<P><CODE>history.dat</CODE> is available from the mame homepage: 
<A HREF="http://www.mame.net">http://www.mame.net</A><P>
<H3>Input logs</H3>

<P>Input logs are saved/read under the name specified after the
<CODE>-record / -playback</CODE> option; this name is relative to the current
path.
<H3>Xmame/xmess still can't find files/store highscores</H3>

<P>Type <CODE>&quot;xmame/xmess -showconfig | more&quot;</CODE> and check that
the rompath and spooldir shown are correct and readable/writable.
Otherwise recheck xmamerc/xmessrc. Remember that xmess also searches
the current dir.
<H2><A NAME="ss3.10">3.10 How do I start xmess/xmame ?</A>
</H2>

<P>To start xmame, type
<P>
<PRE>
    xmame [options] &lt;gamename&gt; [more options]
</PRE>
<P>For xmess, type
<P>
<PRE>
    xmess [options] &lt;systemname&gt; [more options] \
    &lt;disk/romimage(s)&gt; [more options]
</PRE>
<P>All options are optional. ;)
<P>Xmame/xmess supports most dos command line options (see readme.mame
/ readme.mess) as well as a few of its own: Type xmame -help |  more
for a complete list.
<P>With xmess, some systems don't require a disk/romimage, but most
do.
<H2><A NAME="ss3.11">3.11 What are the command line parameters for xmame/xmess?</A>
</H2>

<P>To see a list of available parameters, type:
<P>
<PRE>
    /usr/games/xmame -help | more
</PRE>
<P>Xmame/xmess supports most of the command line parameters as the
DOS  version as well a some of its own.
<P>See the file readme.mame / readme.mess for more information about
the command line parameters.
<H2><A NAME="ss3.12">3.12 What keys does xmame/xmess use?</A>
</H2>

<P>Xmame/xmess uses the same key-bindings as the DOS version of
mame: The following keys work in all emulators:
<P>
<PRE>
    `  or ~      Enter On screen display to change volume, brightness etc.
    Tab          Enter configuration menu. Press Tab or Esc to get back to
                 the emulation.
    P            Pause

<P>Under SDL, xmame can switch to and from different modes during
runtime:
<P>
<PRE>
    Key combo:             Result:
    left-alt + enter       Toggles between windowed and

<H2><A NAME="ss3.13">3.13 Why doesn't a game have sound?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>First check that sound is working in other applications.</LI>
<LI>Check that sound is supported for the game that has no sound;
not all games have sound.</LI>
<LI>For xmame, take a look at gamelist.mame: Is the sound for the
game emulated?</LI>
<LI>For xmess take a look at readme.mess: Is the sound for the system
emulated?</LI>
<LI>Check the operating system support chart in the earlier part
of  this file: Does xmame/xmess support sound on your system?</LI>
</UL>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.14">3.14 My sound seems lagged. / My sound Clicks. / What does -bufsize</A>
 do?</H2>

<P>With the <CODE>-bufsize</CODE> commandline option or the bufsize configfile
keyword, you can specify the number of frames of audio to buffer.
The default is 2 frames.
<P>This value should be ok for everyone, but if you still have problems,
read on.
<P>If the buffersize is to small, this causes the buffer to get
empty between frames which in turn causes clicks/pauses in the sound.
If this is the case, increasing the -bufsize value to, for example,
2.5 should help.
<P>If, however, you make the buffersize too large, then so much
audio becomes buffered, that the sound could become lagged. E.g.,
you would hear the coin drop sound 0.5 seconds after pressing the
insert coin key. In this case, lower the bufsize to, for example,
1.5.
<P>Please let me know if you need to change this setting, since
I'm planning on removing it in a future release.

<H2><A NAME="ss3.17">3.17 Why is xmame/xmess slow?</A>
</H2>

<P>Xmame/xmess is a compiled C program that is emulating hardware.
Software emulation of hardware always incurs a speed penalty. Here
are some things you can do:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Try using the -frameskip command line parameter.</LI>
<LI>Try pressing F8 while running xmame/xmess to alter the frame
rate.</LI>
<LI>Try disabling the throttle with the -nothrottle command line
parameter or by pressing F10 while running xmame/xmess.</LI>
<LI>While running xmame/xmess, press F11 to check the speed of xmame/xmess.
If you never get a display of 100%, you need a faster computer.</LI>
</UL>
<P>You can also try recompiling xmame/xmess with more optimal settings.
The following suggestions may not work or may not be appropriate
on some machines and in some installations.  However, in cases where
they do work, there can be a noticeable increase in overall performance
of xmame/xmess.
<P>These &quot;enhancements&quot; simply require editing the Makefile
that is distributed with xmame, and then recompiling the source.
If you are compiling the source for the second time you will need
to do:
<P>
<PRE>
    make clean
    make
    make install
</PRE>
<P>after editing the Makefile to set your new settings.
<H3>SPEEDUP # 1 - Inline compiling</H3>

<P>Try enabling inline compiling by commenting and uncommenting
the following lines:
<P>
<PRE>
    # IL    = '-DINLINE=static inline'
    IL     = -DINLINE=static
</PRE>
<H3>SPEEDUP # 2 - Direct Graphics Access</H3>

<P>For a big boost, try enabling DGA by uncommenting the following
line:
<P>
<PRE>
    DGA = 1
</PRE>
<P>Then start xmame as root, and press left-alt + home to switch
to dga mode; that should be a lot faster, and doesn't need/use xsync.
;) 
<P>To get back to a window without exiting, press left-alt + insert.
<P>The benefit of DGA is that it is Direct Graphics Access and therefore
writes directly to the framebuffer (think DirectX versus GDI under
MS Windows). So it should be a tad faster, unless you've got a really
really well accelerated X-server, which could be just as fast. Try
pressing F11 to see the actual framerate, although it might be hardly
noticable (visually, at least), it should give you some speed increase.
<P>Besides that, it automatically switches to the right mode and
removes any window manager stuff, but that can be done without DGA
too. (I might add such a feature later, since it allows easy fullscreen
without running as root.)
<P>Adding a 320x240 mode will most definitely get you a very nice
fullscreen display at scale = 1. ;)
<P>Don't forget that you still need to set up the Modes line of
the   &quot;Display&quot; subsection of the &quot;Screen&quot; section
in your X11 config file if you want the games to fill the screen
in DGA mode. Xmame will pick the best mode it can find, so if you
have a line like
<P>
<PRE>
    Modes  &quot;1024x768&quot; &quot;800x600&quot; &quot;640x480&quot; &quot;320x240&quot; &quot;256x224&quot;
</PRE>
<P>then any game which fits into a 320x240 screen can be displayed
in that resolution, and so on. Don't forget your X11 config file
might have a number of different &quot;Screen&quot; sections in it,
and you will need to add Modes to the one that is actually active
with your Xserver is running. And of course it's not always that
easy, since you also need to tell X which monitor settings are required
for these resolution modes. This is done through Modeline entries
in the &quot;Monitor&quot; section of your X config file.
<P>You can check out the <CODE>/contrib/tools/modelines</CODE> file for a set
of crazy modes made especially for xmame in DGA mode. They should
work on any reasonable multisync monitor, but don't use them on an
old fixed-frequency monitor. (And if you can't resist trying, I won't
pay for a new one!)
<H3>SPEEDUP # 3 - NASM</H3>

<P>You can also try installing nasm and compiling the asm core,
that helps a bit too.
<H2><A NAME="ss3.18">3.18 I've got a dual processor machine. What can I do to take full</A>
 advantage of this?</H2>

<P>Not much. Xmame is a single-threaded port of a single-threaded
DOS app. Some degree of speedup will hopefully be found on an SMP
machine since xmame is more likely to get to hog its one CPU for
longer. But of course the same applies to any CPU-intensive program.
And all the things one would normally do to any application to give
it more CPU time (higher priority, kill or renice unecessary process,
etc.) will work with xmame.
<P>Now you may at this point be thinking, "
Surely you could have
one thread doing emulation and another thead doing graphics to get
a speedup."
Yes, but there are some serious issues to consider. The
first is synchronisation between the threads, which needs to be pretty
tight. If not done smoothly. the overhead will blow most of the benefit
away. Also, it needs to be implemented with a portable threads interface
... which basically means POSIX threads. In a nutshell, it's a lot
of effort for probably not much gain. But of course if you are feeling
particulary energetic and in the mood to code, then patches can always
be submitted to the xmame devel mailing list ... :)
<H2><A NAME="ss3.19">3.19 Why doesn't my joystick handle diagonal movement correctly on</A>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.20">3.20 How do I enable XinputExtensions X11 based joystick in Xfree86?</A>

<P>Xmame/xmess versions newer than 0.35 use zlib for some compression
routines. Unfortunately, a lot of Linux distributions have an old
version of zlib installed as /usr/X11R6/lib/libz.a, and the new version
installed as /usr/lib/libz.a. If this is the case, it's harmless
to remove /usr/X11R6/lib/libz.a. If you're not sure whether this
is the case, just move /usr/X11R6/lib/libz.a to another location.
<P>Removing or just moving /usr/X11R6/lib/libz.a should fix this
problem.

<P>Xmame/xmess versions newer than 0.35 use zlib for some compression
routines.
<P>Zlib is standard on most Unix versions. For those who don't ship
with zlib or ship with a version that is too old, xmame/xmess now
comes with a stripped-down version of zlib. Uncomment the appropriate
line in the Makefile to use this.
