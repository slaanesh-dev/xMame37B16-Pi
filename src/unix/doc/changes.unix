Xmame history:

Last Modified by Lawrence Gold (gold@aros.net)

Release 0.37b16.1
	- Everything from MAME 0.37b16 except for steadykey support and the new
	  RGB blitters.  These may be appearing in a later release.  :-)
        - Added Matt Lowry's latest README, which has been missing from xmame
          for several releases.
	- Fixed the contrib/porting/prep-new-mame script so it doesn't omit the
	  README file.
	- QNX Photon2 updates: A fix for dirio.c which allows xmess to compile
	  under the QNX 6.1 internal beta; audio has better verbosity; fixed a
	  bug which caused games utilizing a mouse to core dump.  (Travis Coady)
	- Fixed some ANSI/ISO warnings in the GLmame code.
	- Changed contrib/porting/prep-new-mame to reflect the new .txt files
	  bundled with MAME.
	- Updated contrib/porting/porting.txt to refer to src/windows rather
	  than src/msdos for diffing between versions, since the Win32 target
	  is now the primary one.
	- Updated the docs to mention that KDE 2.2b1 has been reported to fix
	  the xmame.x11 problem whereby the window never displays without using
	  a workaround.

Release 0.37b15.1 (xmame only)
	- Everything from MAME 0.37b15 except for 'steadykey' support.
	- Added an aRts sound server driver.  (Manuel Teira)
	- Added another aRts sound server driver.  It needs reasonable aRts 
	  server settings, something like artsd -F 6 -S 4096 should be ok to get
	  near accurate response time.  (Petr Smotek)
	- ALSA updates: Added preliminary support for ALSA 0.9 API; split the
	  0.5 and 0.9 API stuff into separate files.  (Shyouzou Sugitani) 
	- HotRod support is now enabled by either -hotrod or -hotrodse, just
	  like the DOS/Win32 version.
	- Added dummy flicker and vector orientation functions to fxvec.c so
	  that xmame.xfx can link again.

Release 0.37b14.2 (xmame only)
	- Updated the romulan.pl script in contrib/tools.  (Nathan Hand)
	- The sound device is now released when the emulation is paused.
	  (Shyouzou Sugitani)
	- Updated the comment in makefile.unix about nasm to indicate that v0.98
	  or higher must be used to build the asm 68k cores.
	- Added -hotrod for HotRod and HotRod SE support.  Set it to 1 for
	  HotRod, 2 for HotRod SE.
	- The DGA target now reports whether it's using DGA1 or DGA2.
	  (Christian Groessler)
	- Updated GLmame to version 0.62.  (Sven Goethel)
	- Fixed src/tiny.mak so the tiny build would work.
	- Added the KDE workaround to the documentation.

Release 0.37b14.1 (xmame only)
	- Everything from MAME 0.37b14 except for 'steadykey' support.
	- Major updates to the files in contrib/porting.  Added prep-new-mame
	  and prep-new-mess scripts for porting from the MS-DOS sources.
	- Added new CFLAGS to makefile.unix for more optimal builds under IRIX.
	  (John Gilbert) 
	- Fixed the files in src/unix for which Per Wigren reported problems
	  when using the Tru64 compiler.
	- Incorporated fixes to the core sources for the Tru64 compilation
	  problems. (Nicola Salmoria)
	- Audio now works on the released version of Mac OS X.  (Pete French)
	- Fixed a bug in logerror() that could cause a crash.  (Pete French)
	- Added the German HTML docs.  (Robert Hamberger)
	- Added a note to the docs and makefile about adding -DGLU_VERSION_1_2
	  to the GLCFLAGS when using Mesa's GLU.  (Sven Goethel)
	- Updates to the ALSA dsp driver: cosmetic changes, suppression of bogus
	  warnings about underruns.  (Shyouzou Sugitani)
	- Added new sound driver plugins for IRIX.  (Brandon Corey)
	- Updated the changelog for the ALSA dsp driver.  (Shyouzou Sugitani)

Release 0.37b13.2
	- MESS 0.37b13 is now included.
	- Added an updated romulan.pl to contrib/tools.  (Nathan Hand)
	- Added an updated romalizer to contrib/tools.  (Christopher Stone)
	- Adopted the directory layout used in MESS CVS.  Namely, all of the
	  xmame-specific directories have been moved into src/unix.  Releases
	  will now have symlinks to these directories in the root.
	- Updated the docs to reflect the new mailing list address, courtesy of
	  Pete French.
	- Fixed an unmatched parenthesis error in src/drawgfx.c that was
	  affecting non-Intel platforms.
	- Fixed a bug in mess/cpu/apexc/apexcdsm.c that was causing xmess
	  linking to fail.
	- Updates to the QNX target: Added sound support via an ALSA hack, added
	  fullscreen Photon2 support, and made other miscellaneous Photon2
	  updates and fixes.  (Travis Coady)
	- Updated GLMame to v0.85.  (Sven Goethel)
	- Vector games now work with the SDL target.

Release 0.37b13.1 (xmame only)
	- Everything from MAME 0.37b13.
	- Numerous updates to the OpenGL target.  (Sven Goethel)
	- Added Photon2 display support for the QNX target.  (Travis Coady)
	- You can now run "make clean68k" before building with a different 68k
	  core.  (Mike Coates)
	- Applied a patch from StretchMAME that prevents a bunch of games from
	  segfaulting on startup.  (Shyouzou Sugitani)
	- A fix for the sprites in CVS games.  (Nicola Salmoria)

Release 0.37b12.1
	- Everything from MAME and MESS 0.37b12.
	- The SDL install no longer sets SUID root on the binary.  (Torbjörn
	  Andersson)
	- Updated mame_perl to 1.3.  (Stefan Becker)
	- Added support for the RGB 555 mode for targets which support 16bpp
	  displays.
	- Added support for the RGB 888 mode to the x11_window, DGA, and SDL
	  targets.  (Shyouzou Sugitani, Lawrence Gold)
	- Added -sdlmapkey/-sdlmk to the SDL target to allow the remapping of
	  keys.  This should help users with non-U.S. keyboards.
	- Revised the example key remappings in doc/xmamerc.dist and
	  src/unix/xmamerc-keybinding-notes.txt to match the current keycodes.
	  Also added SDL examples.
	- Added the beginnings of QNX 6/QNX 4 support.  The X11 display driver
	  should at least work.  (Travis Coady)
	- The semicolon/colon and period keys should now work for the SDL target
	  in xmess (tested with the a800 driver). 
	- Updated/added a couple of key mappings (\", :, and <) to match the
	  MS-DOS version.
	- Improved OpenGL support, including better performance, dynamic
	  checking of OpenGL extensions, and dynamic fetching of the max texture
	  size.  (Sven Goethel)

Release 0.37b11.2
	- MESS 0.37b11 is now included.
	- Full DGA 2.0 support, with automatic depth-switching.  A build on an
	  XFree86 4.0.x system will automatically use the DGA 2.0 calls; if the
	  binary with 2.0 support is run on an XFree86 3.3.x system, it will
	  fall back on DGA 1.0 calls.  (Shyouzou Sugitani, Stea Greene, Matt
	  Lowry)
	- Support for either NetBSD or OSS sound under OpenBSD.  The default is
	  the NetBSD sound interface, which reportedly works better.  (Claudio
	  Castiglia)
	- Cleaner install mechanism in the makefiles; included install-sh script
	  from X11R5 for platforms which lack the install command; the default
	  install prefix is now "/usr/local".  (Claudio Castiglia) 
	- SDL mouse support has been added.  (riq)
	- SDL target should now have all previously missing update routines.
	  (riq)
	- Added -joydevname/-jdev option to select the device prefix for the
	  i386 joystick.  Defaults to "/dev/js" for Linux and "/dev/joy" *BSD.
	  (Thanks to Laurent Simon for the suggestion.)

Release 0.37b11.1 (xmame only)
	- Everything from MAME 0.37b11.
	- Merged in changes from the src/unix tree that were in the MESS CVS;
	  one of which is that if MAME_DEBUG is enabled, the binary will be
	  called xmamed.<target> or xmessd.<target>.  (Christopher Stone)
	- Commented out the call to osd_dirty_merge() in SDL.c.  The SDL target
	  has its own dirty handling.  (Hans de Goede)
	- The menu colors no longer fade when you pause a game.  (Sean Young)
	- xmess compiles again without having to uncomment VLM5030 in
	  src/mess.mak. (Christopher Stone, Lawrence Gold)
	- make -f <makefile> tools should work again for xmess.
	- Possible fix for a problem with the DGA target on ATI Rage Mobility
	  which caused a switch to fullscreen mode to not change the resolution.
	  (Lawrence Gold)
	- -listgamelist no longer prints the column headers (they are shown by
	  -listgamelistheader).  (Lawrence Gold)

Release 0.37b10.1
	- Everything from mame 0.37b10 and mess 0.37b10
	- ALSA sound driver uses stream mode; this fixes the problem of
	  continuous static during games.  (Shyouzou Sugitani)
	- Running with DGA 2.0 no longer causes a blank screen with Matrox
	  G200/G400.  (Shyouzou Sugitani)
	- The asm 68k code compiles again.  (Agawa Koji)
	- Building on older gcc, non-gcc, and FreeBSD 3.3 systems works much
	  better.  (Pete French, Olivier Galiber)
	- New unified OpenStep 4.2 Intel/Mac OS X PowerPC code.  (Pete French)
	- The SDL driver now has video_update for 16bpp_to_16bpp; SDL_HWPALETTE
	  was added to the flags of SDL_SetVideoMode (Ricardo Quesada)
	- New version of the mame_perl ROM manager.  (Stefan Becker)
	- Fixes for getcwd/getwd for BSD43 systems.  (Pete French)
	- Running with -listsamples no longer causes a core dump.  (me)
	- Sprite corruption fix for the NES driver.  (Christopher Stone, Sean
	  Young, Brad Oliver)
	- The SDL driver now supports 32bpp XFree86 modes.  (Dan Scholnik)
	- The SDL driver now has fullscreen support.  (Patrice Mandin)
	- The back-quote/tilde key now toggles the on-screen display when using
	  the SDL driver.  (me)
	- Gave credit to Tadeusz Szczyrba for writing the original SDL driver.
	- Added a needed call to fflush() in the error logging.  (Christopher
	  Stone).
	- The frontend code (-list options) should more or less resemble its
	  MS-DOS counterpart.  Thanks to Christopher Stone for pointing out the
	  problem areas.
	- Added an "openbsd" ARCH define.  (Claudio Castiglia)
	- Fixed some core files to allow building under Solaris 8 using its 
	  native cc.  (Vincent ^_^)
	- Changed the optimization flags in the Makefile for the IRIX platform
	  so that the comment about turning on all optimization holds true.
	  (Chris McCraw)
	- The svgafx target should run again; a call to osd_dirty_merge() had to
	  be commented out.  (henri)
	- Updated the docs to mention problems using Red Hat 7's latest gcc;
	  added suggestion for using ALSA with OSS emulation if OSS problems are
	  experienced.
	- Added a top-level README; removed old-changes.mess, which was
	  identical to messold.txt; extended copyright notice to 2001 and listed
	  Lawrence Gold as maintainer in config.c.  (Matt Lowry)

Last Modified by Hans de Goede (hans@highrise.nl)

Release 0.37b7.1
	- Everything from mame 0.37b7, no mess yet
	- Added support for USB joysticks under FreeBSD thanks to:
	  Christian Weisgerber <naddy@unix-ag.uni-kl.de>
	- Fixed xmame hanging with the message:
	  WARNING: the game might not run correctly.
	  Press any key to continue
	- Made the debugger always use the aspect ratio of the actual monitor,
	  instead of the aspect ratio of the emulated game.

Release 0.37b6.1
	- Everything from mame 0.37b6 & mess 0.37b5 & 0.37b6
	- Alsa sound driver, thanks to: Luc Saillard <luc@alcove.fr>
	  also please send any questions in his direction since I don't
	  have alsa and thus can't test this.
	- Applied a small fix to src/cpu/adsp2100/adsp2100.c, which
	  should fix mk3 and friends, thanks to: Frank Cox
	- Fixed a core bug causing ataxx and brutforc to crash.
	- Some crc and cheatfile changes for xmess by Christopher Stone
	  * The crcdir now defaults to XMAMEROOT/crc
	  * Added a new cheatdir (option -cheatdir) defaulting to
	    XMAMEROOT/cheat
	  * Default cheatfile for MESS is now cheat.cdb
	    (this filename actually gets changed in the core now to
	     gamename.cdb, if the user wants to use her own filename,
	     she can just use anything except cheat.cdb or cheat.dat
	     and it will not be renamed in the core)
	  * xmess now looks for cheat files in cheatdir/filename
	- NETbsd USB joystick driver, thanks to: Krister Walfridsson
	- IA64 support, YEAH, thanks to: Christian Groessler <cpg@aladdin.de>
	- Made XF86-DGA honer -disablemode
	- SGML(linuxdoc) based documentation many many thanks to
	  Rene Herrmann <Rene.Herrmann@gmx.de>
	  The .lyx file is the master file I use, so please submit either
	  patches against the .lyx file, or just plain text additions.
	  Patches against the .sgml file are of no use to me.
	- Added a doc target to the makefile which generates the docs
	  from the sgml source and generates gamelist.xxx, xxxxxxrc.dist and
	  xxxxxx.6 .
	- Openstep fixes, openstep should work out of the box now, thanks to:
	  Pete French <pete@toybox.twisted.org.uk>
	- Fixed crashes in svgafx for games which resize the screen, like
	  mkla4.
	- Fixed crashes in 8 bit X-windows with games which resize the screen,
	  like mkla4.
	- Fixed crash on exit in svgaXX displaymethods, when using the mouse
	  and running games which resize the display, like mkla4.
	- Support for the new "graphical" mame debugger. This uses just one
	  window resizing it to the debugger or normal size, using seperate
	  windows for each is something xmame's current architecture is
	  not designed for. This might still happen in the future but not
	  before a rewrite of the video subsystem.
	- Added -debug-size / -ds XXXxYYY, with this you can specify the
	  width and height of the debug window, please keep in mind that
	  the minimum size is 640x480.
	- You can now change the scale of a window on the fly with
	  leftshift +:
	  Insert	Increase widthscale
	  Delete	Decrease widthscale
	  Home		Increase heightscale
	  End		Decrease heightscale
	  Page Up	Increase scale
	  Page Down	Decrease scale
	- Added a partly autogenerated manpage, thanks to
	  Rene Herrmann <Rene.Herrmann@gmx.de>
	  
Release 0.37b5.1
	- Everything from mame 0.37b5, no mess yet!
	- The asm m68000 core is currently broken, so don't use it! ,
	  on the brighter side of things, neogeo games seems to
	  be working with the C-core now.
	- Fixed the segfault when exiting the xgl version.
	
Release 0.37b4.1
	- Everything from mame & mess 0.37b3 & 0.37b4
	- Note neogeo games don't seem to work this release with the C 68000
	  cpu core, use the asm one instead.
	  (Non x86 users seem to be outa luck, for this release only I hope.)
	- Changed the makefile to use the new dos makefiles:
	  -No more makefile editing for each release
	  -No you can build tinymame / neomame / neofree mame too.
	   (just set TARGET to neomame / tiny)
	  -Also much cleaned up
	- Added support for debugging on b/w xterm's thanks to:
	  cpg@aladdin.de
	- Updated romalizer to 0.61, thanks to: 
	  TKMAME <tkmame@retrogames.com>
	- Updated opengl support now also works with uthaglx, and vectors
	  have been fixed for nvidea. Thanks to:
	  Tony Hoyle <tmh@magenta-logic.com>
	- Added support for mess snapshots (-snapshot) thanks to:
	  "Wojciech Walaszkowski" <walaszkowskiw@prokom.pl>
	- Added -hiscorefile parameter to specify the location of highscore.dat
	  Thanks to: TKMAME <tkmame@retrogames.com>
	- Added a blurb to readme.unix about needing hiscore.dat to get
	  highscores to work.
	- Made svgafx and xfx honor -[no]keepaspect for those who want to fill
	  the entire screen.
	- Updated the mame_perl rom tool to 1.1 . Thanks to:
	  Stefan Becker <Stefan.Becker@nokia.com>
	- Added tools target to the makefile, to build the platform indepent
	  tools.
	- Added gamelist target to the makefile to generate gamelist.<target>
	- Added SYSDEP_DSP_O_NONBLOCK parameter to the sysdep_dsp_create flags,
	  currently only implemented for esound and OSS. And not guaranteed to
	  actually work.
	- Made sound_stream.c check the return value of sysdep_dsp_write,
	  incase it doesn't succeed / doesn't write all data. This should
	  fix xmame with alsa's OSS emulation.
	- Added Dingus Family <ddingus@usewest.net> as irix maintainer to
	  readme.unix
	- Added Jacob A. Hart <c9710216@studentmail.newcastle.edu.au> as
	  freebsd maintainer to readme.unix
	- If you don't specify a specific cheatfile xmess will now
	  now uses XMAMEROOT/system.cdb instead of cheat.dat, this
	  doesn't affect mame thanks to Chris <tkmame@retrogames.com>
	- Readded openstep soundsupport thanks to:
	  Pete French <pete@toybox.twisted.org.uk>
	- Cleaned up src/unix/sysdep/misc.* so that the system headers
	  are only included in the .c file.
	- Cleaned up src/unix/osd_cpu.h to mach the above changes.
	- Added a special case to both osd_cpu.h and misc.c for openstep
	  since CLOCKS_PER_SEC is not defined and should be 64 on openstep.
	- Added a blurb to doc/readme.unix about adding modelines to XF86Config
	  Thanks to: Matt Lowry <mclowry@cs.adelaide.edu.au>
	- Changed rc.c so that it no auto prepends no for clearing booleans,
	  allowing for short boolean options.
	- Added short options for most options thanks to:
	  Christopher Stone <tkmame@retrogames.com>
	- Made -help honor the COLUMNS environment variable, thanks to:
	  Christopher Stone <tkmame@retrogames.com>
	- Changed the config file parsing order a bit, now also parses global
	  per game config files, see -help output, thanks to:
	  Christopher Stone <tkmame@retrogames.com>
	- Added prelimenary sgml-ised version of xmame-docs, see doc/html.
	  Many thanks to: Rene Herrmann
	- Xmame should no longer crash when compiled with DGA and run as root
	  on a remote display. (Work around for an XFree86 bug)
	- Xmames frontend code now checks for games which don't use any roms,
	  yet still have a ROM_REGION defined. Like the "genesis" driver under
	  xmess.

Release 0.37b2.2
	- 0.37b2.1 featured a rewrite of the keyboard handling to add unicode
	  support, unfortunatly I only adopted the x11 based drivers, and
	  forgot the others, so only the x11 based ones compiled. This release
	  has much cleaned up and rewritten keyboard support for:
	  -svgalib
	  -ggi
	  -xgl
	  -xfx
	  -svgafx
	- Made the unicode support for X11 actually work (shift and altgr are
	  now honered)
	- Corrected a small type in makefile.obj-xmess, thanks to:
	  Peter Trauner
	- Fixed the creation of tape images in xmess, thanks to:
	  Oscar Martín González
	- Updated the romalizer script in contrib to v0.6, thanks to:
	  tkmame@larry.ztnet.com

Release 0.37b2.1
	- Everything from mame & mess 0.37b2.
	- Fixed brightness handling on pause, the brightness no longer
	  gets darker and darker if you pause/unpause a lot.

Release 0.37b1.2
	- (Re)added mess 0.37b1, including everything that's new.
	- The solaris sound drivers now uses AUDIODEV if set thanks to:
	  Keith Hargrove.
	- Made sound update synchronious with video update,
	  this should improve sound quality.
	- Fixed a crash when running with -nosound -fakesound.
	- Added detection of buggy FreeBSD newpcm driver, and fallback
	  to timerbased audio when detected.
	- Slightly changed the fragsize calculation in the oss dsp plugin,
	  again, it now uses slightly smaller frags, which should increase
	  sound quality a bit.
	- Changed the default soundbufsize to 3.0, this is still smaller as
	  before the default bufsize before the sound rewrite, and it seems
	  that the 2.0 was a bit to optimistic.

Release 0.37b1.1
	- Everything from mame 0.37b1, no mess yet, if you want mess
	  use 0.36.1 .

Release 0.36.1
	- Everything from mame & mess 0.36rc2 & 0.36 final.
	- Fixed a compile error in the solaris dsp-plugin.
	- Removed cheat,doc, cheat.dat and history.dat as they were out of
	  date, get the most rescent version from http://www.mame.net.
	- Slightly changed the fragsize calculation in the oss dsp plugin,
	  it now takes the samplerate used into account.
	- Added -verifyromsets and -verifysamplesets, both are less verbose,
	  more easy parsable versions of -verifyroms resp -verifysamples.
	- Added a number of hints about compiling for optimal performance
	  to readme.unix, thanks to: Frank Cox <theatre@spreda.sk.ca>
	- The i386 joystickdriver now also supports freebsd, thanks to:
	  Robert Muir <rmuir@looksharp.net>
	- Fixed (rewrote) the console switch handling for svgalib / svgafx,
	  it now works with version 1.4.1 and higher compiled without
	  background support (such as distributed with RedHat 6.2).
	- Improved ggi mode selection, added -xres, -yres to force a
	  certain mode, thanks to Christian Groessler.
	- Openstep support has been updated for the new palette code, so
	  the openstep version should compile again. Still no sound
	  though, thanks to: Bat.
	- Changing the volume under Solaris should no longer cause the
	  sound to stop working, thanks to Mathis Rosenhauer.
	- Solaris sound has been reported to work for SunOS too.

Release 0.36rc1.1
	- Everything from mame & mess msdos 0.36rc1
	- Cleaned up the -list options output and made it more consistent,
	  this could cause some slight problems with frontends, but
	  the changes aren't that big. This should be the last time the
	  format changes (I hope).
	- Changed -bufsize to be in frames, so that it automagicly scales
	  for games which have more / less frames / sec. The default of 2
	  should be fine for everyone, please lett me know if you need to
	  change this option, if no-one needs it it will be removed in a
	  future release.
	- Added a sound buffering layer on top of the new core sound mixer
	  code. This is nescesarry, since the new buffering code only allows
	  very slightly variating the number of samples per frame, and with
	  OSS for example the number of samples per frame could variate a
	  lott.
	- Fixed OSS sound plugin compilation under freebsd.

Release 0.36b16.1
	- Everything from mame & mess msdos 0.36b16
	- Fixed error messages for: "error optionx requires an argument".
	- Fixed --boolean option parsing.
	- Fixed bools in configfiles overriding commandline.
	- Fixed printing of NULL strings in -showconfig.
	- Fixed -vectorres for vertical oriented games.
	- Reworked and cleaned up the makefile, you can now choose your os
	  and cpu seperatly. This adds linux-sparc support amongst other
	  things.
	- Made oss.c compatible with linux/powerpc giving sound on this
	  platform thanks to John Cramp.
	- Wrote a generic plugin system, currently only supporting static
	  plugins, but prepared for dynamic plugins.
	- Rewrote the entire sound subsystem, to match a few core changes.
	  Sound-drivers are now plugins, allowing for example esd support.
	  All sound drivers need to be converted to this new system.
	  Platforms which sound-driver(s) haven't been converted, don't
	  have sound.
	- Added a sound-mixer (for volume control) subsystem, again plugin
	  based.
	- Converted the oss driver to be a dsp plugin.
	- Added an oss mixer plugin.
	- Updated (fixed) SDL display driver, thanks to: Ricardo Calixto
	  Quesada (riq@ciudad.com.ar).
	- Added an esound dsp plugin.
	- Fuzzy name matching alla the dos port, thanks to: Andrea Vettorello
	  <molotov@dei.unipd.it>.
	- Don't parse the game specific rc file untill the final name lookup
	  has been done (for fuzzy / random name matching).
	- Converted the netbsd sounddriver to be a dsp plugin, thanks to:
	  Krister Walfridsson <cato@df.lth.se>
	- Removed emulation of analogjoysticks using the mouse, this is now
	  done by the core.
	- Converted the solaris sounddriver to be a dsp plugin, added
	  a mixer plugin thanks to: Mathis Rosenhauer

Release 0.36b15.2
	- Fixed the X11 target when compiled with XIL but without
	  MITSHM.
	- Fixed compiling on machines without DGA (sorry about this one ;)
	- Added -version / -V to show the version, mainly for frontends.
	- Fixed -listclones.
	- Now accepts both -option and --option (--version for example)
	- -showconfig no longer tries to print string options which are
	  NULL.
	- Updated german readme, thanks to: Robert Hamberger
	- Renamed signal to sound_signal in src/sndhrdw/geebee.c, this
	  should fix compiling it under HP-UX

Release 0.36b15.1
	- Everything from mame & mess msdos 0.36b15
	- Removed the IRIX specific c-compiler entry in the makefile
	  as this doesn't work on all machines, and shouldn't be needed
	  on most others. Added hint about adding -DHAVE_SNPRINTF to
	  CFLAGS for IRIX 6.5 .
	- Changed all occurences of xmame.retrogames.com to x.mame.net .
	- Completed contrib dir documentation.
	- Added nvram file support.
	- Fixed -gamma-correction and -brightness.
	- Fixed (worked around) xgl crash with nvidea xgl drivers.
	- Rewrote the config file susbsytem. It's much more modular now and
	  can be used for other projects.
	- Did the rename and move blues to get all the options in the
	  modules where they belong. Removed a lott of global symbols.
	- Xmame/xmess now parses all configfiles found starting
	  with the most global files, and ending with the gamespecific file.
	  The later parsed files can overwrite options in the previous
	  parsed files.
	- Each videomethod compile now only supports it's own options. In order
	  to get rid of the warnings xmame now also parses a videomethod
	  specific file, where you can put the videomethod specific config
	  parameters. Taking the x11 video method as an example the extra
	  parsed files are:
	  $XMAMEROOT/xmame-x11rc and
	  $HOME/.xmame/xmame-x11rc for 
	  See doc/readme.unix for more info.
	- Added mame_perl-1.0 to contrib/tools. Yet Another Romsets Manager
	  by: Stefan Becker

Release 0.36b14.1
	- Everything from mame-msdos 0.36b14 & mess-msdos 0.36b14.
	- Fixed make install for xmess
	- Fixed -ident crash
	- Fixed a small xmess link error
	- Sorta fixed galaxian & clones (they run now)
	- Updated the email adress for the openstep maintainer
	- Added a suggested set of german keymappings to doc/xmamerc.dist,
	  thanks to: Peter Trauner
	- Implemented crc checking for xmess, added -crcdir option.
	- Added crc database files from the mess dos distribution.
	- Readded the 16bpp speedup using int copies for DGA, since it is now
	  in the generic palette system, it is now also used for regular X and
	  GGI.
	- Xmame now detects if 16bpp is not available and falls back to 8bpp
	  automagicly.
	- Added color approximation in X11-window 8bpp mode, this means
	  that -privatecmap isn't needed anymore to get a non-black emulation,
	  -privatecmap is still faster though.
	- Made the mouse buttons seperate buttons instead of piggy backed upon
	  the joystick buttons, as the latest dos releases.
	- Fixed a header conflict with the xgl target

Release 0.36b13.1
	- Everything from mame-msdos 0.36b12 & mess-msdos 0.36b12 &
	  mame-msdos 0.36b13 & mess-msdos 0.36b13.
	- New palette subsystem for the new 16 bpp paletised modes,
	  making life easier for the display drivers, still room
	  for improvement but a good start.
	- Updated german readme thanks to: Robert Hamberger
	- HP-UX compilation fixes, thanks to: Stefan Becker
	- Netbsd 8 bit sound fix, thanks to: Krister Walfridsson

Release 0.36b11.1
	- Everything from mame-msdos 0.36b9 & mess-msdos 0.36b9 &
	  mame-msdos 0.36b10 & mess-msdos 0.36b10 &
	  mame-msdos 0.36b11 & mess-msdos 0.36b11.
	- These changes include a changed output for -verifyroms which could
	  break some frontends
	- These changes also include some palette changes: -[no]16bitvideo
	  has been removed and replaced by -bpp xxx (auto,8 or 16).
	  If your display can only handle 8 bpp you should specify -bpp 8.
	  Otherwise the default of auto will do fine.
	- Fixed the x86-asm m68000 cpu core compile problems.
	- Fixed problems with mess emulations which use r/w disk images,
	  note that these don't support gzipped or zipped images.
	- Fixed possible bufferoveruns with very long rompaths in
	  fileio.c. This was never a security risk since xmame drops root
	  rights before doing any fileio.
        - This also changed the behaviour of -rompath it now longer adds a 
          path to the rompath but instead replaces the entire rompath.
	- Added a portable standalone snprintf implementation from mutt,
	  for those platforms which don't have snprintf. Add
	  -DHAVE_SNPRINTF -DHAVE_VSNPRINTF to DEFS.arch if your platform
	  has these functions to use your libc implementation and not the
	  one shipped with xmame, and please lett me know. This has already
	  been done for: linux-* netbsd-* freebsd
	- Fixed problems with -verifyroms failing on zippedroms with
	  the wrong names but right checksums, while playing the game works
	  fine.
	- Added virtual root support to the -run-in-root-window option,
	  now xmame can be used as a part of xscreensaver ;)
	- Wrote a little script to run a random game in the root window for 2
	  minutes and then run another random game etc. Use this as the extern
	  command for xscreensaver, it is in contrib/tools/xmame-screensaver .
	  Usage:
	    - compile the x11 version of xmame
	    - install it somewhere in your path
	    - copy xmame-screensaver to /usr/games
	    - edit ~/.xscreensaver , and add a line:
	      /usr/games/xmame-screensaver
	- Really fixed the glide compile problems <sigh>.
	- Alpha sound fixes, thanks to Christian Groessler.
	- Rearranged the contrib directory, now everything is devided into
	  a few subdirs: frontends, patches, porting and tools.
        - Added / updated a few readme's in the contrib dir (not complete yet).
	- Fixed timerbased audio in combination with xf86-DGA.
	- Fixed netbsd joystick support to use the correct device names.
	- Fixed up the artwork searching method to be a bit more logical,
	  see readme.unix for a description .

Release 0.36b8.1
	- Everything from mame-msdos 0.36b7 & mess-msdos 0.36b7 &
	  mame-msdos 0.36b8 & mess-msdos 0.36b8
	- Merged in the new 0.36b7 mess release. You can now specify if
	  you want to build mess or mame at the top of the makefile.
	  Xmess and xmame are built in a seperate obj dir so you can safely
	  build both in the same tree, even at the same time if you want to.
	- Renamed lotts of doc files for the mess merge, see the doc dir.
	- Replaced all occurances of j.w.r.degoede@et.tudelft.nl with
	  hans@highrise.nl which is my new email the old one will disappear
	  soon. Also fixed any url's still referring to the old homepage.
	- Replaced #include <glide.h> by #include <glide/glide.h>. So you
	  nolonger have to specify /usr/include/glide as additional include
	  path.
	- Fixed xmame setting the root cursor to invisible when switching to
	  fullscreen with the mouse grabbed.
	- Fixed xmame forgetting that it had the mouse grabbed when to focus
	  was switched away with the keyboard under enlightenment.
	- You can't grab the mouse anymore when you specify -nomouse.
	- Changes the svgalib tweaked mode code a bit, the 240x272 mode has
	  been removed since it was broken. Added some more tweaked modes
	  from the dos team including some planar tweaked modes:
	  384x256
          384x240
          384x224
          336x240
          256x240
          256x256 vertical orientation
          240x256
          Note if you use -noplanar you won't get the tweaked planar modes
          either.
        - Added -centerx <#> -centery <#> with these you can change
          the center of all tweaked modes.
        - Added scanline support to 320x240
	- Svgalib version now restores textmode when mame exits with:
	  Error: gfx[0] extends past allocated memory
	- Changed -list output to seperate the different games with spaces
	- Added romalizer 0.53 to the contrib dir this is a tcl script
	  for cleaning up your rom collection by: Christopher Stone
	  For more info see tkmame.retrogames.com.
	- The asm68000 core is know to cause problems, and the speed gain is
	  not impressive. Documented this.
	- Sunos is now on the supported list, thanks to
	  Saga <jolletx@cybercable.fr>
	- Rethinked the way the rompath was handled, if you want the old
	  behaviour and your rompath was:
	  rompath /foo:/bar
	  change it into:
	  rompath /foo/roms:/foo/samples:/foo/artwork:/bar/roms:/bar/samples:/bar/artwork
	  For an exact description of the new rompath handling for both
	  xmame and xmess see readme.unix.
 	- Experimental sample synchronysing code in src/unix/sound.c
	  should decrease the incident of dropped/skipped samples.
	  This is disabled by default you can enable it with -samplesynch,
	  see readme.unix for more info.
	  Please give it a spin and mail your experiences to the xmame-list.
	  Thanks to William A. Barath.
	- Updated barath frameskip code with load detection.
	  Thanks to William A. Barath.
	- Added a alsa-sound driver to the contrib dir as alsa.c copy it
	  over src/unix/sound-drivers/oss.c and add -lasound to EXTRA_LIBS
	  in makefile.unix. Thanks to "Who Wants to Know?"
	- You can now run xmame / xmess in your root-window as screen-saver
	  / background. This can be enabled with -run-in-root-window.
	- Added random game support option, specify random as game to
	  play a random game ;)
	- New openstep video code supporting scaling and 16bpp video modes
	  Thanks to Bat
	- New openstep makefile entries now with support for:
	  - OpenStep for Intel
	  - OpenStep for Motorola
	  - OpenStep for Sparc
	  - Mac OS X for Intel
	  - Mac OS X for PPC
	  Thanks to Bat
	- Completly rewritten ggi video code with:
	  - scaling
	  - 16bpp support
	  - works on 8, 16, 24 and 32 bpp X servers
	  Thanks to Christian <cpg@aladdin.de>

Release 0.36b6.1
	- Everything from msdos 0.36b4 & b5 & b6
	- Lotts and lotts of thanks goto William A. Barath for
	  sorta taking my place while I was busy switching jobs and for a
	  lotts of the improvements in this release.
	- After a lott of discussion on the mailinglist about which
	  frameskipping method is the best, selectable frameskipping methods
	  have been added. Use -frameskipper # or the frameskipper keyword
	  in xmamerc to configure this. The frameskipmethod can also be
	  changed runtime with left-control + key combinations.
	  Currently available frameskippers are:
	  0   lctrl+insert   Dos frameskipping code
	  1   lctrl+home     Improved frameskipping code thanks to  William A.
	                     Barath
        - added toggleable idle sleeping "-[no]sleepidle" which can make
	  xmame run smoothly on a loaded machine as well as freeing the
	  CPU so we can do more than just play games... :) This defaults
	  to -nosleepidle. You can see that it is enabled by an 'S' in the
	  fps display. There also a T there if throttle is enabled. This can
	  be toggled runtime with shift + F10. Thanks to William A. Barath.
	- added upper-bound for autoframeskip "-maxautoframeskip <#>" which
	  assures a playable framerate even if the emulation can't keep up
	  with real time. Thanks to William A. Barath.
	- Made -geometry work for fx and gl versions, it can be used to
	  specify the windowsize / resolution now. Thanks to Nguyen The Toan
	- Fixed XIL (again) Thanks to Taso N. Devetzis
	- Fixed screenshots for 16bpp games. Thanks to Mathis Rosenhauer for
	  the hint where the problem was.
	- It turn out that xmame compilation breaks when using egcs-1.1.x or
	  gcc-2.95, added note to use -fno-strict-aliasing to fix it.
	  gcc-2.95.1 does work with -fstrict-aliasing, and gives a nice
	  speed increase.
	- Quieted make output. Thanks to David R. Hampton
	- Fixed making of obj/cpu/m68000/m68kops.o to not use implicit rules
	  this was needed for the quieting to work. This should also
	  make our openstep users very happy.
	- Preliminary SDL display target. Thanks to: Tadeusz Szczyrba
	- Fixed the trailing problem in a lott of dirty using games thanks
	  to William A. Barath for pointing me in the right direction.
	- This also fixes the > 7 frameskip values to not skip more frames
	  then asked.

Release 0.36b3.1
	- Everything from msdos 0.36b3
	- Fixed a bug in the new svgalib code which caused modes which are
	  non tweaked, non planar and nonlinear to stay black / crash.
	  This should also fix the problems people where having with vector
	  games.
	- Fixed svgafx compilation, Thanks to: "Chris, Lo Cheuk Kong"
	- Fixed svgafx running suid root
	- Added console switching to svgafx
	- Removed -fxgamma this was not possible with a clean solution to
	  suid root 3dfx support.
	- Fixed 16bpp modes on cards which use 65536 colors instead of 32678
	  with svgalib, thanks to: William Barath
	- Workaround for a DGA bug on Matrox G100 cards which causes the
	  display to be corrupted. Thanks to: d.swanson
	- Made -listroms respect -stdout-file by: Chris from TKMAME
	- Fixed xgl compilation.
	- I couldn't find a clean and portable way to tell Mesa to init glide
	  without switching to 3d mode, which is needed since glide needs to
	  be initialised before any commandline parsing is done for security
	  reasons. Thus setuid root support for Mesa on glide is broken.
	  Use /dev/3dfx instead. Any help appreciated.
	- Added autoconf to the cutdown zlib instead of the generic unix
	  makefile.
	- Added the original copyright notice to the cutdown zlib (oops)
	- Removed the .o en .a files from contrib-zlib as distributed,
	  added removing them to make clean (oops 2)

Release 0.36b2.1
	- Everything from msdos 0.36b2.
	- Fixed tweaked mode restoration after console switch with svgalib
	  for the soon to be releases svgalib 1.4.1 thanks to: Matan Ziv-Av
	- Fixed the pause(BREAK) key. It should have worked from the start,
	  I don't know how this bug slipped in.
	- Fixed the cheat menu.
	- Added auto doubling of width- or heightscale for 1:2 pixel aspect
	  games (like goldstar). Use -noautodouble to disable.
	- Added optimsed scaling code for 1x2x scaling for 1:2 pixel aspect
	  games (like goldstar)
	- Added new mode selection code for svgalib and DGA which not only
	  tries to fill the entire screen but also tries to keep the aspect
	  ratio correct. Use -nokeepaspect to get the old behaviour
	  of trying to fill as much screen as possible.
	  Thanks to: William Barath
	- Implemented 16bpp modes for X11 in a window, DGA and svgalib. Xmame
	  uses these modes when available and nescesarry. use -no16bitvideo to
	  disable them.
        - Enhanced -disablemode now it is either of:
          -disablemode XresxYres
          -disablemode XresxYresxDepth
          Use it with xDepth to disable a mode just for a certain colordepth
          Accepted depths are: 256, 65536.
	- Implemented scaling other then 1x1 and 2x2 for 24bpp packed pixel
	  modes.
	- Rewrote joystick handling code to match the new core handling code
	  Xmame now supports upto 8 joysticks with upto 16 axis / stick and 
          upto 16 buttons / stick. Adding more sticks/axis/buttons is just a
	  matter of changing a few #define's now. Since xmame now supports 
          more then 2 axis -[no]swapjoyaxis has been removed.
	- Fixed saving of more then 1 snapshot.
	- Fixed -widthscale 2 -heightscale 1 for DGA and svgalib
	- Added contrib/modelines. This is a file with a bunch of tweaked mode
	  modelines for XFree86. Kindly contributed by William Barath
	- Xmame now saves cfg, sta and mem files in seperate dirs in
	  $(HOME)/.xmame So if you want to keep your old ones move them.
	  Files:	Go in / become:
	  XXX.cfg	$(HOME)/.xmame/cfg/XXX.cfg
	  XXX.mem	$(HOME)/.xmame/mem/XXX.mem
	  XXX.sta	$(HOME)/.xmame/sta/XXX.sta
	  And xmame now searches for game specific rc files as:
	  $(HOME)/.xmame/rc/<gamename>rc
	  Thanks to: TKMAME
	- Added a cutdown version of zlib in contrib which can be used
	  instead of the system wide version (see makefile.unix). For 
	  systems which have no or a broken zlib. Thanks to: Matt Lowry
	- Rewrote svgalib mode selection code (again) now it doesn't use
	  a static list of modes anymore but queries the available modes
	  from svgalib like DGA does under X11. This means that special
	  modes in svgalib replacements like scitech display doctor and
	  ggi can be used.

Release 0.36b1.2
	- Added emulation of arcade cabinet lights through the keyboard leds
	  for svgalib. X doesn't seem to support this, help appreciated.
	- Added -geometry option, to specify the location where
	  the xmame window appears.
	- Added -[no]linear to enable/disable linear framebuffer support with
	  svgalib. It defaults to off since lfb is broken on some cards.
	  This fixes the black screen problem some people where having.
	- Added a keymapping for the ^ key on german keyboards so that the
	  on screen display works under X.
	- Reordered the output for -help so that it makes more sense.
	- Added a few accidently ondocumented options to -help
	- Fixed xgl, xfx, svgafx and openstep compile. Since I don't have
	  openstep and / or an 3dfx over here this is untested.
	- Changed -scale, -widthscale & -heightscale so that they do the
	  logical thing. Meaning that the last one parsed determines
	  the scales used.
	- Added -vectorres <XresxYres>, this scales vectorgames to XresxYres,
	  keeping their aspect ratio. This overrides the scale options.

Release 0.36b1.1
	- Everything from msdos 0.36b1
	- With al the testing of the svgalib code, a bug which has been
          there for ages has been found and fixed. This bug cause a shifted
	  and cropped screen with games which require a resolution >= 640x480
	  and visualsize != size
	- Rewrote the svgalib mode selection code, -videomode was removed.
	  Use -[no]tweak and -[no]scanlines instead
	- Added linear framebuffer support to the svgalib code
	- Added doublebuffer support to svgalib scaled modes
	- Added -disablemode <XRESxYRES> option for svgalib this can be used
	  to disable a specific mode when it gives trouble on your system.
	  So that for example only one troublesome tweaked mode can be disable
	  instead of disabling all tweaked modes.
	- Improved doublebuffer alloc code for XF86DGA, don't malloc the
	  buffer if it isn't used.
	- Improved doublebuffer avtivation code it is now also used for
	  2x2 scanlines mode giving a nice speedup.
	- Removed the unix-only core-patch to align words according to Nicola
	  this shouldn't be nescesarry anymore. If you have trouble running
	  z80 (and probably other) games on non intel machine's. Try applying
	  the patch, it is in contrib/ as word-align-patch
	- Changed the xkeymappings back so that the winkeys (META) are mapped
	  to alt. This was nescesarry to support international keyboards.
	- Added -[no]winkeys to map the winkeys under X (META) to the winkeys
	  under xmame. Use this if you have a winkeyboard and want to use
	  your windows keys under xmame. This option doesn't do anything for
	  non X versions of xmame.
	- Added -screenshotdir <dir> to specify where xmame saves the png
	  screenshots made by pressing F12. It defaults to the current
	  working dir (.) .
	- Added the IRIX buggy compiler fix for MWA_NOP to MRA_NOP too,
	  this should fix a load of games on IRIX. You could ofcourse
	  also use a real compiler, grrr.

Release 0.35.3
	- Really fixed the bug in the svgalib code, now it's also
	  fixed for resolutions >= 640x480, and thus for vector games.

Release 0.35.2
	- Fixed a nasty bug in the svgalib code

Release 0.35.1
	- Everything from msdos rc2, 0.35 release + fixes
	- Some alpha compile and alignment fixes (by Christian Groessler)
	- Added netbsd-alpha as target (by Christian Groessler)
	- Some powerpc compile fixes
	- Windows keys are now recognised and can be used, under X
	  your X needs to be configured properly for this though

Release 0.35rc1.1
	- Everything from msdos b13 & rc1 highlights:
	  - Now all display targets do snapshot in png format
	  - png support needs zlib, since png is in the core zlib is
	    now mandatory
	  - history.dat file location can now be specified
	- Updated German README
	- Many changes to the blit-core these include:
          -use memcpy's to speed up where possible
          -use doublebuffering when doing direct framebuffer access,
           and scaling.
          -simulated scanlines when scaling
          -hand optimised cases for 3x and 4x inproved generic case
          Overall this should give a nice speedup in a lott of cases.
          Much of the work and ideas where contributes by a kind soul whos
          email and name I've lost. If you read this please mail me so you can
          be given proper credit.
        - Don't crash on exit when no suitable DGA mode can be found
	- Made xmame emmit warnings and continue on errors in xmamerc, instead
          of emmit errors and exit (By TKMAME)
	- Made xmame except fxmame and glmame options even when not compiled
          with fx / gl, it just ignores them.
	- Added some boundary checks in: sound/adpcm.c and vidhrdw/megasys1.c
	  this fixes edf in b12. I don't know wether it's still nescesarry in
	  rc1, thus these changes are backed out and are now available in:
	  contrib/boundary-check-patch

Release 0.35b12.1
	- Everything from msdos b11 & b12
	- Changed the way the makefile handles the generated c-files for the
	  m68000 c-core again. Now openstep should be happy too.
	- Changed TRUE -> OSD_OK in a number of sounddrivers this should fix
	  compile problems for: irix, netbsd_i386 and aix.
	- Added a spanish tranlation of the readme by Vicente Aguilar.

Release 0.35b10.2
	- Fixed a bug in the config parsing code which caused core dumps at
	  start on most non x86 platforms.
	- Changed the way the makefile handles the generated c-files for the
	  m68000 c-core. Now it also works with compilers which don't like
	  object files with an unusual suffix (.og instead of .o).

Release 0.35b10.1
	- Everything from msdos b10
	- Updated the debuger code, now it should work again and it looks a
	  lott better as the old code.
	- GGI support updated for ggi2.0b2 and some other small fixes.
	  By Christian Groessler
	- As requested changed the init sequence for x11 so that -list options
	  can be used even without a display. This only works for binaries
	  without DGA support due to security reasons.

Release 0.35b9.1 (Never got released the mame team released b10 before)
	- Everything from msdos b9.
	- Updated solaris sound-driver which also supports solaris i386.
	  Thanks to Mathias for this.
	- Installed solaris x86, Fixed XIL.
	- Also fixed mitshm on solaris.
	- Some fixes to fix-comments to handle nice c-code like: '"' and "\\"

Release 0.35b8.1
	- Everything from msdos b8.
	- Note about history.dat:
	  The new dos-release uses a file called history.dat to display some
	  nice background info on games. Unfortunatly the location of
	  history.dat is hardcoded into the core as just history.dat in the
	  current working directory. Thus if you want to use it you need to
	  start xmame in the dir where history.dat resides or at least create
	  a shell script which cd's into this dir before executing xmame.

Release 0.35b7.1
	- Everything from msdos b7.
	- Added -listinfo option
	- Did the rename and move blues, lotts of restructering of the unix
	  code. End users won't notice this except that it probably has
	  introduced a couple of bugs ;)

Release 0.35b6.1 (Aka naming releases was fun while it lasted)
	- Everything from msdos b6
	- Added 24bpp packed pixel support for X11 by Trent Piepho
	- Added 24bpp packed pixel and 32 bpp support to xf86-dga
	- Removed the z80 fix. Jurgen, from the dos team, has fixed the z80
	  core so that it now works with gcc 2.7.2.x too. Please reports
	  any new problems with z80 games.

Release 0.35b5.1 (Aka yar (yet another release))
	- Everything from msdos b5
	- Fixed a vsb (very stupid bug) which caused xmame
	  to hang on exit sometimes
	- Reintroduced the z80 fix from 0.35b2, you only need it if
	  your using gcc, you can disable the fix in the makefile if your
	  using egcs for a slight performance increase. This only affects
	  x86 users. Also note that since the dos-team now is using gcc 2.8.1
	  more of these bugs might popup, so if you have egcs use it.

Release 0.35b4.2 (Aka the brown paperbag release)
	- Fix a compile bug in src/unix/config.c

Release 0.35b4.1
	- Everything from msdos b3 & b4.
	- contrib/fix-comments.c no longer generate: /*/////*/ but instead:
	  /*///////////// */
	- Nicola from the dos-port honored my request and in one go all
	  ACORN and linux_alpha defines have been changed to ALIGN_INTS,
	  ALIGN_WORDS and LP64, thanks Nicola
	- Before parsing $HOME/.xmame/xmamerc xmame now first looks if
	  $HOME/.xmame/<gamename>rc exists and parses that instead if found.
	  By Chris (from TKmame) 

Release 0.35b2.1
	- Everything from msdos b2.
	- An interesting note from whatsnew.txt,
	  which might be worth repeating:
	  Note: the configuration save format has changed. You may just as well
	  delete all of the cfg/*.cfg files, since they won't be loaded. Old
	  .inp files will not work either. The good news is that the default
	  key assignments can now be modified, so you don't have to change them
	  for all the games. The code is a quick hack put together in fifteen
	  minutes, but it's bettern than nothing. It will be improved
	  in future versions.
	- Worked around the compilation of the z80-core with -DX86_ASM, still
          working on this with Juergen
	- Added 16 bit & stereo sound-support. Many thanks to Mike Oliphant
	  For writing this. Use -mono, -8bit to get the old behaviour back.
	- Added a new blitting macro, now used for svgalib, X en dga.
	  taking away a lott of old almost the same code. This also means that
	  X now uses direct image access even in truecolor modes speeding
	  things up quite a bit. And update_dsp* files were all removed since
 	  since they are now unnescesarry.
	- The above is really all added bonus, the mean reason was to also
	  write a generic scaling system. So now dga and svgalib also support
	  scaling.
	- Removed -forcetrucolor, since it doesn't do anything anymore with
	  the new blitting macro.

Release 0.35b1.1
	- Everything from msdos including autoframeskip use:
	  -autoframeskip / -noautoframeskip to en-/disable.
	  It's enabled by default.
	- Bat wrote snapshot support (F12) for openstep.

Release 0.34.2
	- Fixed a bug which caused:
	  X Error of failed request:  BadValue
	  When running in a window under X11 with a game which doesn't
	  support dirty, and has a visual area which isn't quad-word aligned.

Release 0.34.1 
	- Everything from dos 0.34 final
	- The mouse is now ungrabbed when the window looses focus.
	- Ggi dirty support, tested with ggi 2.0beta1

Release 0.34rc2.1
	- Everything from dos rc 2
	- Added mouse grabbing, press left-alt + page-down to grab the mouse
	  under X, press it again to release it. Use -grabmouse to start
	  with the mouse grabbed.
	- Added invisible mousecursor for people using focus follows mouse,
	  use -nocursor to make the cursor invisible, grabbing the mouse as
	  above also makes it invisible. This was kindly contributed by:
	  Dave Dribin
	- Removed ROMPATH, SPOOLDIR etc defines from makefile.unix and
	  replaced them with XMAMEROOT by Christian Groessler
	- Fully intergrated openstep support, it now no longer needs the files
	  in contrib, see README.unix
	- Added sound synchronisation for streamed sound, this should fix
	  the lag in pacman. This only works when throttle is enabled.
	- Netbsd-i386 audiobuffer querying support by: Tom Spindler

Release 0.34rc1.1
	- Everything from dos rc 1
	- Merged in glmame-0.6 and fxmame-0.5
	- Fixes for ggi to compile with the latest ggi-snapshot
	- Some fixes to -verifyroms to now use -stdout-file
	- Added preliminary openstep support, see contrib/openstep/README
	  Kindly contributed by Bat.

Release 0.34b8.1
	- Everything from dos beta 8
	- DGA now is a compile option for x11, just like mitshm,
	  use -x11-mode (see -help) to choice between normal window and
	  DGA, or use left-alt + home as a hotkey to jump to fullscreen,
	  and left-alt + insert to jump to a window.
	- Rearranged and rewrote most of the joysticks support, upto 4
          joysticks are now supported. And you can compile in more then 1
	  one joytype, and select which one will be used runtime with -joytype.
	- Support for new linux joystick driver interface, use I386JOYSTICK
	  if the new headers are found they are automaticly used.
	  By: Luca Montecchiani
	- Removed -display commandline option as it intervened with DGA,
	  sorry about that, use $(DISPLAY) instead, or write a wrapper script.
	- Added support for mame's internal debugger, see makefile.unix
	  only enable this if you need it! It's slow.
	- Which obj files are build in the unix dir is now display-method
	  dependent.
	- Unixware7 support by: Richard Cohen

Release 0.34b7.1
	- Everything from dos beta 7
	- Completly new dirty code speeding up xf86,x11 and svgalib
	  quite a bit.
	- -analogmouse options to emulate a analogjostick through the mouse
	  very nice for starwars and maybe others.
	- -verifyroms no also tries to load roms by crc matching the actual
	  loading behaviour.

Release 0.34b6.1
	- Everything from dos beta 6
	- Fixed a bug which caused all checksums to be 0 for non-zipped
	  files.
	- Fixed unpause bug.
	- If not shared with the game, the ui colors are no longer
	  influenced by brightness and gamma settings.
	- Made -widthscale, -heightscale and -scale work for vector games
	  on all supported display-methods, using mame's vector engine todo
	  the scaling. Also for vector games values like 1.5 and even 0.5 are
	  now supported.
	- Spend a lott of time on network support, it should now work for
	  all displaytargets. Exiting one participant no also exits
	  the others instead of hanging them. Timeouts implement, if one side
	  is killed/ connection is broken xmame will continue in single player
	  mode. The network code can now be concidered stable, but still only
	  supports keyboard.
	- Merged in fxmame-0.4 and glmame-0.5
	- Vector.o and inptport.o are compiled in display_method dependend
	  dirs now.
	- Solaris XIL support (hardware scaling) by Elias Martenson.
	- Preliminary Digital Unix support by Leandro Dardini
	- Added tkmame frontend to contrib

Release 0.34b5.2
	- Fixed the __extension__ compile bug, I hope
	- Fixed the segfault when compile without joystick-support &
	  joy = 1 in xmamerc
	- Merged in gl-mame code, many thanks to Mike Oliphant for the
	  excellent and easy to merge patch. see doc/README.xgl
	- Merged in net-mame code, many thanks to Eric Totel, for the also
	  excellent and easy to merge patch. see doc/multiplayer-readme.txt
	- Added a volume xmamerc and commandline option.

Release 0.34b5.1
	- Everything from dos-0.34b4&b5, including the profiler, romident
	  asm 68000! and on screen display.
	- Removed /dev/audio (uLaw) support from linux, since it
	  was seriously broken en useless anyway. The audiodevice option
	  is from now on only usefull to use a second soundcard, see
	  doc/xmamerc.dist.
	- Rearranged most of the code in src/unix/fronthlp.c it's a lott nicer
	  now.
	- Rewrote src/unix/config.c it was nescesarry adding new options is so
	  much easier now. This also means that for consistency with the
	  commandline a lot of options in xmamerc have been renamed and/or
	  added, please copy xmamerc.dist over, and change it as needed.
	- Added -fragsize & -numfrags, see -help and doc/README.unix. This 
	  should help people who experience lagged sound. As a side-result of
	  this all soundbuffers are now dynamicly allocated and thus all OSS
	  problems should be gone, please report any remaining problems.
	- Added -stdout-file and -stderr-file to redirect stdout and stderr to
	  a file at a highlevel so svgalib doesn't bug us. Only usefull for
	  frontends, and only influences text printed by the osd part of
	  xmame, so -list and stuff are redirected, -verifyroms only partial,
	  and mame-core errors and messages are not redirected at all.
	- Cleaned up stdout/stderr use:
	  Stdout is used for requested info like -list options, and -help.
	  Stderr is used for status and error messages.
	- Partially rewrote palette-handling no brightness and gamma-
	  correction are supported, see -help, xmamerc and osd.
	- Robert Hamberger kindly donated a german translation of the readme.
	- New irix AL sound support by Tristram Scott, added Tristram as sgi/irix
	  maintainer.
	- linux-powerpc is now offically supported.
	- Added Mathis Rosenhau as sun/solaris maintainer.

Release 0.34b3.1
	- Everything from dos-0.34b3
	- Fixed the compilation problem on some platforms in config.c
	  (missing includes for sys/stat.h and unistd.h)
	- Speeded up palette cycling under xf86_dga with 8bpp
	- Rewrote X mouse handling now mouse works under xf86_dga
	- Added support for 15bpp truecolor visuals
	- Fixed irix_nosound and aix_nosound targets
	- Fixed a bug in osd_fseek which caused sample loading to fail,
	  now samples work as advertised.
	- Fixed a bug in svgalib & ggi palette handling which caused
	  some strange effects with translucent vectors.
	- Updated README.unix to contain who maintains which arch/os
	  combination and which are currently unmaintained,
	  maintainers wanted!
	- Added a section to README.unix on howto work around yet another
	  bug in the irix c-compiler. See the platform specific hints.
	- Added doc/TODO

Release 0.34b2.2
	- Fixed a bug: .cfg files where still saved in ${HOME}/xmame
	  instead of ${HOME}/.xmame.
	- On startup existence of ${HOME}/.xmame is verified and created
	  if nescesarry
	- On startup a check is done to see if compiled- and
	  runtime-endianess match (actually this has been there for
	  a few releases now but I forgot to mention it ;)
	- Some minor updates to README.unix
	- One note: /usr/games/lib/mame has been changed to
	  /usr/games/lib/xmame for concistency. So rename it, or use the old
	  setting in xmamerc.

Release 0.34b2.1
	- Everything from dos-0.34b2.
	- Everything unix from xmess-0.2b4.1:
	  *Fileio no supports gzipped files and a search path, see README.unix
	   Note: This means that you have to change mamedir to rompath
	   in your xmamerc.
	  *Updated README.unix to contain info on both xmess and xmame
	   not only on xmame.
	  *The title and other reference to xmame/xmess and version are now no
	   longer wrapped in ifdef's but instead are taken from defines set by
	   the makefile so to change the version no, or the name only the 
	   makefile has to be changed from now on.
	- Changed ${HOME}/xmame to ${HOME}/.xmame on popular request so
	  move that dir ;)
	- Makefile.objs no is no longer autogenerated due to some changes
	  in the dos makefile. These changes do mean that the number of objs
	  on the commandline at once have been greatly reduced. So those
	  who got a cmdline to long error shoould be happy now.
	- Updated contrib/porting.txt to include the manual creation of
	  makefile.objs. Added contrib/lowercase which is used for this.
	- Changed fix.c to fix-comments.c which is a more accurate name.
	- Removed autogeneration of makefile.objs from make-makefiles.pl
	  renamed it to fix-includes
	- Updated fix-mame to match the name changes of fix and
	  make-makefiles.pl .
	- General clean-up and restructering of README.unix with much thanks
	  to: Joseph E. Miele
	- The x86-asm m6808 core now also works on other i386 unices, thanks
	  to: Christian Groessler

Release 0.34b1.1
	- Everything from dos-0.34b1.
	- Intergrated xf86-dga support.
	- Hardware palette cycling (as promised way too long ago).
	  It's enabled automaticly, you'll receive a notice of this.
	  Under XFree86 it only seems to work on 8-bit displays with
	  a private colormap (-privatecmap).
	- Changed makefile so that you now choose:
	  a) arch
	  b) display method
	  So we no longer have linux-svgalib and linux-x and linux-ggi and
	  linux-xf86-dga. This esp makes sence since ggi and xf86-dga are
	  also supported on other arch's.
	- Added soft-klipping to the soundmixer. Actually done in 0.33.1
	  but I forgot to mention it there.

Release 0.33.3
	- Again fixed the m6808 asm core, this time a work around for
	  gnu-make not liking a long dep chain.

Release 0.33.2
	- Fixed a minor bug which made the compilation of the x86-asm 
	  m6808 cpucore fail.

Release 0.33.1
	- All the changes from dos-0.33(final).
	- Workaround for an of by one bug in newer oss (the linux sound driver)
	  versions. This caused the big delay for this release and hopefully
	  is now solved.
	- Workaround for an obscure irix compiler bug this means irix is
	  now fully supported, but don't use DCC !
	- Added contrib/xnetmame.tgz this contains files for (beta) network
	  play.
	- Added contrib/esound.diff, apply for sound output to the esound
	  deamon, this patch will be included in a newer version.
	- Added contrib/xf86-dga.diff, apply for xfree86 dga support, this
	  patch will be included in a newer version.
	- Updated contrib/mamex to work with newer versions of mame.
	- Added contrib/mamex.new, an enhanced version.

Release 0.33rc1.1
	- All the changes form dos-0.33rc1
	- Automated the porting process a bit, changed contrib/make-makefiles.pl
          not to generate a malloc-lines log. Since this is not nescesarry
	  anymore. Added contrib/fix-mame. See contrib/porting.txt for
          a quick description on how to use these porting tools, to get a new
          dos version ported to unix.
        - Part of these automation changes it that the objs generated by
	  make-makefiles are now used in makefile.unix by including
	  makefile.core.
        - Due to the above changes also all core-filenames have been made
	  lowercase, finally bringing unity.
	- Changed the compiler hints in README.unix not to use DCC,
	  since that was a bad advice which was causing the malloc trouble in
          the first place. We still have irix problems when using -n32
	  which are being looked into. For now use -o32 when compiling.
	- Added support for the m6808 asm cpu core, it has its own flag in the
	  makefile and defaults to off, this is only tested for linux-x86-elf
	  if anyone wants to get it to work on other x86 archs feel free
	  todo so. And please mail me your results. This requires a copy
	  of nasm, a free x86-asembler, in your path. 
	- Added 16 bit sound calls support.

Release 0.33b7.1
	- All the changes form dos-0.33b7, including a new frontend
	  option (-listclones).
	- Fixed the volume after menu setting bug, for real this time
	- Split update_dsp into true- and pseudo-color specific files,
	  with the hope to one day add a 16 bit mode truecolor variant
	- Cleaned up the error handling in the creation of the X display
	- When running xmame on a remote console mit-shm doesn't only fail
	  but it even tells you it failed amasing isn't it?

Release 0.33b6.1
	- All the changes form dos-0.33b6, including some new frontend
	  options (-listgames, -noclones).
	- Cleaned up keyboard-handling a bit.
	- Changed osd_analog_read to match the new syntax.
	- Added -root_window_id [id] cmdline option to create the window
	  within an existing window, to be used with frontend's
	- Added a credits.unix file, if you think you deserve an entry please
	  remind me, I don't remember all contributers.

Release 0.33b5.1
	- Just a port of dos-0.33b5, using the unix tree from
	  0.33b4.1. Nothing new on the unix-end but the main MAME team has
          added a few new goodies to this release.

Release 0.33b4.1
	- Basicly a port 0f 0.31.1 to 0.33b4
	- added 320x240 and 320x400 to svgalib-version
	- some changes to support the new 0.33 layer code

Release 0.31.1
	- A lott has happenend since the last release, before this release
	  there have been a lott of beta's. And I (Hans) have taken over as
	  main coordinator. This release fixes all known bugs to previous 
	  release's. And we've done our best to make this the best release
	  ever. In the switching and the quick beta-period to catch up,
	  changes have got lost however. The Changes file will be updated from
	  here on again.

Release 0.18

	- Original sources from repository

SOUND TESTED ON:
	linux (i586/133) sounds acceptable
	Irix  (SGI Indy ) near nice
	Solaris ( Sparc5 SUNW,CS4231 ) poor, but usable
		( Sparc1+ SUNW,am79c30 ) horrible, better dont use
		( Sparc10 SUNW,dbri ) need more work ( too delayed and tickly )
	AIX	( Reported by Chris Sharp <sharp@hursley.ibm.com> )
		
KNOWN BUGS ( ONLY UNIX SPECIFIC INCLUDED ):
	- AUDIO_TIMER_FREQ is machine dependent
	- Cannot correctly control audio channels in Sparc ( doc wrong :-( )
	- Low quality in audio
	- Some games send long sound samples ( like soundtracks ) that overruns 
	  buffers and make core : -( 
	- Some games dump core when exiting. Don't know why...

TODO:
	- Make it runnable in servers that has no support for 8-bit depht
	  Visuals ( Actually warns and exit )
	- Support for kernel in-built n-channel mixer in Irix
	- Joystick support under Irix ( using the analog input port )
	- Rewrite mixer and buffering sound module
	- Full support of Sparc sound ( lots of bugs in actual one )
